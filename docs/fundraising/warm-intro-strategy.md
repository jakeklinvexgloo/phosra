## 1. Intro Path Taxonomy

Every warm intro follows one of these path types. When mapping your network, tag each path with its type to identify gaps and optimize coverage.

### 1.1 Direct 1st-Degree Connections

**Definition:** People you know personally and have direct contact with (phone, email, prior working relationship).

**Sources to audit:**
- Phone contacts
- LinkedIn 1st-degree connections
- Email inbox (last 3 years of correspondence)
- Former co-workers from prior exits and Mastercard
- Personal friends who work in VC, startups, or tech

**Action:** Export full LinkedIn connection list. Filter for titles containing: Partner, Principal, Associate, Angel, Founder, CEO, Venture, Capital, Investment.

**Expected yield:** 15-30 direct paths.

### 1.2 2nd-Degree via Mutual LinkedIn Connections

**Definition:** People connected to your 1st-degree contacts who can facilitate an introduction.

**Technique:**
1. For each target investor, view their LinkedIn profile
2. Note "Mutual connections" count and names
3. Assess strength of your relationship with each mutual connection
4. Prioritize mutuals who are founders the investor has backed (strongest signal)

**Expected yield:** 30-50 paths.

### 1.3 3rd-Degree via Advisors/Board Members

**Definition:** Paths routed through an advisor or board member of a target fund, or through someone who knows a fund's advisor.

**Technique:**
1. Research advisory boards of target funds (check fund websites, LinkedIn, Crunchbase)
2. Map your network connections to those advisors
3. For each advisor, identify which of your contacts knows them and can make the bridge

**Expected yield:** 10-20 paths.

### 1.4 Conference/Event-Based Connections

**Definition:** In-person connections made at industry events, creating natural context for follow-up.

**Upcoming Events (Feb-Apr 2026):**

| Event | Date | Location | Relevance |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| RSA Conference 2026 | Apr 6-9, 2026 | San Francisco, CA | Cybersecurity/compliance investors attend; child safety sessions |
| SXSW 2026 | Mar 7-15, 2026 | Austin, TX | EdTech/child safety panels; startup pitch competitions |
| ASU+GSV Summit 2026 | Apr 2026 (TBA) | San Diego, CA | Premier EdTech investor conference; 600+ investors attend |
| FOSI Annual Conference | Mar-Apr 2026 (TBA) | Washington, DC | Family Online Safety Institute; direct policy/investor nexus |
| Collision 2026 | Jun 2026 | Toronto, ON | Large tech conference with investor matching; slightly past deadline but good for pipeline |
| National Center for Missing & Exploited Children Tech Conference | Spring 2026 (TBA) | DC Area | NCMEC events draw child safety tech investors |
| Child Safety Summit (various) | Q1 2026 | Various | Monitor TSPA, FOSI, NCMEC for smaller regional events |
| RegTech Rising / COMPLY Conference | Spring 2026 | Various | RegTech-focused investor gatherings |

**Technique:**
1. Register for events with investor networking components
2. Research speaker lists and attendee profiles in advance
3. Schedule 1:1 meetings through event apps before arriving
4. Follow up within 24 hours of meeting with personalized message referencing your conversation

**Expected yield:** 10-15 paths per event attended.

### 1.5 Portfolio Company Founder Introductions

**Definition:** Getting introduced to an investor by a founder they have already backed. This is the single highest-converting warm intro type.

**Why it works:** Investors trust their own portfolio founders more than anyone else. A portfolio founder saying "you should meet this person" is the strongest possible signal.

**Technique:**
1. For each target fund, look up their portfolio on their website or Crunchbase
2. Identify portfolio founders you know directly or can reach through your network
3. Prioritize founders whose company has thematic overlap (compliance, safety, SaaS, B2B)
4. Reach out to the portfolio founder first, build rapport, then ask for the intro

**Expected yield:** 15-25 paths (assuming 50+ target investors with 5-15 portfolio companies each).

### 1.6 Accelerator/Incubator Alumni Networks

**Definition:** Alumni connections from startup accelerators/incubators create a built-in warm intro network.

**Relevant programs to investigate:**
- **Y Combinator:** Largest alumni network; many YC companies in adjacent spaces (compliance, identity verification, trust & safety). YC alumni Slack/forums actively facilitate intros.
- **Techstars:** Strong regional networks; Techstars Workforce Development accelerator has child safety adjacent companies.
- **500 Global:** Wide geographic reach; active LP network.
- **MassChallenge:** Non-dilutive; strong Boston/DC policy connections.
- **Plug and Play:** Enterprise/regtech focus; corporate partnership pipeline.
- **SOSV/HAX:** Hardware+software; relevant if Phosra has device-level components.
- **Creative Destruction Lab (CDL):** Strong Canadian tech network.

**Technique:**
1. If you are an alumnus: Use alumni directory and Slack channels to find founders connected to target investors
2. If not an alumnus: Identify alumni founders in child safety/regtech/compliance space through Crunchbase; they often help non-alumni founders as well
3. Apply to relevant accelerators as a secondary benefit for network access

**Expected yield:** 5-15 paths.

### 1.7 Industry Association Connections

**Definition:** Professional organizations in child safety, trust & safety, and regulatory technology create dense, mission-aligned networks.

**Key Associations:**

| Association | Acronym | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Trust & Safety Professional Association | TSPA | Direct industry body; members include platform safety leaders and investors |
| Family Online Safety Institute | FOSI | Policy-focused; connects tech companies, policymakers, and funders |
| National Center for Missing & Exploited Children | NCMEC | Deep child safety network; government and tech connections |
| Internet Watch Foundation | IWF | UK-based; strong European child safety investor connections |
| WePROTECT Global Alliance | WePROTECT | Global policy body; connects to government-backed funding sources |
| International Association of Privacy Professionals | IAPP | Privacy/compliance professionals; overlaps with investors in privacy tech |
| EdTech industry associations (ISTE, SIIA) | ISTE/SIIA | EdTech investor connections; school district buyer connections |
| Information Technology Industry Council | ITI | Policy-tech bridge; useful for DC-based investors |

**Technique:**
1. Join relevant associations (many have free or low-cost membership)
2. Attend member events and working groups
3. Volunteer for committees to build deeper relationships
4. Use member directories to identify connections to target investors

**Expected yield:** 10-15 paths.

### 1.8 Content-Based Warm-Up (Social Selling)

**Definition:** Building familiarity with a target through consistent, valuable engagement on their public content before making a direct ask.

**The "Digital Body Language" approach:**
- This is a 2-4 week slow-burn strategy for high-value targets you cannot reach through other paths
- Creates recognition and positive association before the ask
- Particularly effective for investors who are active on LinkedIn or Twitter/X

**Execution (see 7-day LinkedIn plan in Templates section):**
1. Follow the target investor on LinkedIn and Twitter/X
2. Like and leave thoughtful comments on their posts (not generic "Great post!" -- add genuine insight)
3. Share their content with your own commentary that demonstrates domain expertise
4. Reference shared interests (child safety legislation, regulatory compliance, etc.)
5. After 1-2 weeks of consistent engagement, send a connection request with a personalized note
6. After connection accepted, send a brief DM referencing a specific conversation thread

**Expected yield:** 10-20 paths (for hard-to-reach targets).

### 1.9 Shared LinkedIn Group Connections

**Definition:** LinkedIn groups create a "2nd-degree equivalent" connection allowing direct messaging to group members.

**High-Value Groups to Join:**
- Venture Capital & Private Equity Professionals
- AngelList Community
- RegTech / Regulatory Technology
- Child Safety Online / Trust & Safety
- EdTech Founders & Investors
- SaaS Founders & Operators
- Pre-Seed / Seed Stage Startups
- GovTech Founders

**Technique:**
1. Join 10-15 relevant groups
2. Post valuable content in groups to build visibility
3. Identify target investors who are group members
4. Use group membership as context for connection request ("Fellow member of RegTech Professionals...")

**Expected yield:** 5-10 paths.

### 1.10 Alumni Networks (University & Corporate)

**Definition:** Shared alma mater or former employer creates immediate rapport and a natural reason to connect.

**Networks to leverage:**
- **University alumni:** Check alumni directories for VCs, angels, and founders. Most schools have venture clubs and startup networks.
- **Mastercard alumni:** Former colleagues now in VC, corporate venture, or angel investing. Mastercard's fintech/payments network is extensive.
- **Prior exit company networks:** Former co-founders, employees, investors, and acquirers from 3 prior exits. These people have direct knowledge of your execution ability.
- **Industry certification cohorts:** If applicable (CPA, CISSP, CIPP, etc.)

**Technique:**
1. Search alumni directories filtered by "Venture" "Investment" "Angel" "Startup"
2. Send alumni-specific connection requests referencing shared background
3. For Mastercard alumni: Leverage internal alumni network or LinkedIn alumni tool

**Expected yield:** 10-20 paths.

### 1.11 Podcast Guest-to-Host Connection Paths

**Definition:** Appearing as a podcast guest or connecting through podcast hosts who interview both founders and investors.

**Relevant podcast categories:**
- Child safety / online safety podcasts
- RegTech and compliance technology podcasts
- EdTech founder podcasts
- Pre-seed / early-stage fundraising podcasts
- Trust & safety industry podcasts

**Technique:**
1. Identify podcasts where target investors have appeared as guests
2. Connect with the podcast host (hosts are natural connectors)
3. Offer yourself as a guest (child safety compliance is a timely, compelling topic)
4. After appearing, ask the host for introductions to investors they know
5. Reference the podcast appearance as social proof in outreach

**Expected yield:** 5-10 paths.

---

## 2. High-Leverage Connector Profiles

"Super connectors" are people who sit at the intersection of multiple networks and can generate 5-10+ intro paths each. Investing time in these relationships has outsized ROI.

### 2.1 Startup Attorneys (Pre-Seed Specialists)

Startup attorneys talk to dozens of founders and investors weekly. They are among the most effective connectors in the early-stage ecosystem.

**Target Firms:**

| Firm | Why | Pre-Seed Strength |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| **Cooley LLP** | Largest startup law practice; deep VC relationships | Handles 40%+ of VC-backed company formations |
| **Goodwin Procter** | Strong in fintech/regtech; active Boston + SF presence | Known for pre-seed / seed work |
| **Wilson Sonsini** | Silicon Valley anchor; invented SAFE notes with YC | Premier early-stage practice |
| **Gunderson Dettmer** | Pure-play startup law; every partner knows 50+ VCs | Specifically focused on emerging companies |
| **Orrick** | Strong tech transactions practice; active in compliance/govtech | Good European connections too |
| **Fenwick & West** | Deep Silicon Valley roots; strong in privacy/data | Privacy law expertise relevant to Phosra |
| **Latham & Watkins** | Larger firm but active emerging companies practice | Strong cross-border capabilities |

**Approach:** Engage a startup attorney for your SAFE/formation work. During the engagement, ask: "Which pre-seed investors in your network focus on compliance, safety tech, or regtech?" Most attorneys will make 3-5 introductions without being asked twice.

**Expected connector yield:** 3-5 intros per attorney relationship.

### 2.2 Angel Group Organizers

People who run angel groups and syndicates have curated networks of active investors and can broadcast your deal to dozens simultaneously.

**Types to target:**
- **Angel syndicate leads** on AngelList (filter for regtech/compliance/edtech)
- **Regional angel group organizers** (Golden Seeds, Tech Coast Angels, New York Angels, Sand Hill Angels, Keiretsu Forum)
- **Thematic angel group leads** (women in tech, impact investing, etc.)
- **Online community leaders** (On Deck Angels, Hustle Fund Angel Squad, AngelMatch)

**Approach:** Apply to present at angel group meetings. Many accept applications from pre-seed companies. Even a "pass" results in network exposure.

### 2.3 Accelerator Partners/Mentors

| Program | Key Partners/Mentors | Connection Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Y Combinator** | Group partners, visiting partners | Apply for W26/S26 batch; connect with YC alumni founders in safety/compliance |
| **Techstars** | Managing directors, mentors-in-residence | Each Techstars program has 100+ mentors; many are active angels |
| **500 Global** | Venture partners, EIRs | Strong emerging market connections; active LP network |
| **SOSV** | General partners, program managers | Deep tech focus; relevant for technical infrastructure plays |
| **Plug and Play** | Corporate innovation partners | Enterprise connections for sales + investment |

**Approach:** Even without being in a program, many accelerator mentors are accessible through events, office hours, and LinkedIn. Techstars, for example, runs open mentor office hours.

### 2.4 Recently-Raised Founders in Adjacent Spaces

Founders who raised their pre-seed/seed in the last 6-12 months are the best tactical advisors and connectors because:
- They know which investors are actively deploying capital RIGHT NOW
- They can tell you which partners to target at each fund
- They remember the pain of fundraising and are often willing to help
- An investor who passed on them might be looking for exactly what you offer

**Adjacent spaces to search (Crunchbase/PitchBook filter: raised in last 12 months):**
- Trust & safety platforms
- Age verification / identity verification
- Parental control software
- EdTech compliance
- Privacy management / consent platforms
- Content moderation
- Regulatory technology (any vertical)
- GovTech / civic tech
- Digital wellbeing / screen time

**Approach:** DM them on LinkedIn or Twitter/X. Lead with: "Congrats on the raise! I'm building in a related space (child safety compliance) and would love to learn about your fundraising process. Happy to share what I'm seeing in the market too."

### 2.5 Industry Analysts Covering RegTech/Child Safety

Analysts publish research, speak at conferences, and maintain contact lists spanning hundreds of companies and investors.

**Key analyst firms/individuals to target:**
- **Gartner** analysts covering GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)
- **Forrester** analysts covering trust & safety, digital ethics
- **CB Insights** analysts covering regtech
- **PitchBook** analysts covering child safety / edtech
- **Independent analysts** with active newsletters/Substacks on child safety legislation

**Approach:** Offer to be a source for their research. Analysts need data points and case studies. Position yourself as an expert on the COPPA 2.0 / Kids Online Safety Act compliance landscape.

### 2.6 Conference Organizers

Conference organizers know every speaker, sponsor, and VIP attendee. A single relationship with an organizer can yield 10+ introductions.

**Target organizers for:**
- ASU+GSV Summit (education/tech investor conference)
- FOSI annual events
- TSPA conferences
- RSA Conference (child safety track)
- SXSW (EdTech/safety track)
- Collision / Web Summit
- TechCrunch Disrupt (startup alley)

**Approach:** Volunteer to speak, moderate a panel, or sponsor. Even a small sponsorship ($500-2K) at a niche event gives you organizer access and attendee lists.

### 2.7 VC Scouts and Associates

Scouts and associates are the most accessible people at VC firms and often have direct influence on which deals get partner attention.

**How to identify scouts:**
- LinkedIn title: "Scout" "Venture Scout" "Deal Sourcer" "Investment Analyst"
- Twitter/X bios mentioning "sourcing" for specific funds
- VC firm team pages (associates and analysts are listed)
- AngelList scout program participants

**Approach:** Scouts are actively looking for deals. They are the easiest path into a fund. Connect directly on LinkedIn, share your deck, and ask for feedback. Even if the scout's fund passes, they often know 5-10 other investors to introduce you to.

## 3. Warm Intro Request Templates

### Template 1: Asking a Mutual Connection for a Double-Opt-In Intro

**Subject:** Quick intro request -- child safety compliance startup

> Hi [Connector Name],
>
> Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I noticed you're connected with [Investor Name] at [Fund Name], and I think there could be a strong fit for what I'm building.
>
> I'm raising a $950K pre-seed for Phosra -- we're building compliance infrastructure for the 67+ child safety laws hitting platforms worldwide (COPPA 2.0, Kids Online Safety Act, EU Digital Services Act, etc.). Think of us as the "Stripe for child safety compliance" -- one API to handle age verification, parental consent, content restrictions, and audit reporting across all jurisdictions.
>
> I have 3 prior exits and spent time at Mastercard building compliance infrastructure, so this is a space I know deeply.
>
> Would you be comfortable making a double-opt-in intro? Totally understand if the timing or fit isn't right -- no pressure at all. I've included a short blurb below that you can forward if you'd like.
>
> Thanks so much,
> [Your Name]

**Why this works:**
- Names the specific connection (shows you did your research)
- Concise value prop in one sentence
- Credibility signals (3 exits, Mastercard)
- Explicitly asks for double-opt-in (shows social awareness)
- Includes a forwardable blurb (makes it easy for the connector)
- Gives an out ("no pressure at all")

---

### Template 2: The Forwardable Blurb

This is what the connector sends to the investor. Make it dead simple to copy-paste.

> Hey [Investor Name],
>
> Wanted to connect you with [Founder Name], who's building something I think is right in your wheelhouse.
>
> **Phosra** -- compliance infrastructure for child safety laws. 67+ new laws worldwide (COPPA 2.0, KOSA, EU DSA) are creating a massive compliance burden for any platform with users under 18. Phosra provides a single API for age verification, parental consent gates, content moderation rules, and audit reporting -- all mapped to specific jurisdictions and updated automatically as laws change.
>
> **Why I think you'd want to meet [Founder Name]:**
> - 3 prior exits as a founder
> - Built compliance infrastructure at Mastercard
> - $950K pre-seed raise, [SAFE / specific terms]
> - Already has [traction metric: e.g., "LOIs from 3 platforms" / "working prototype" / "pilot customers"]
>
> Happy to make the intro if you're interested -- just reply and I'll connect you both.

**Why this works:**
- Written from the connector's voice (they can forward as-is)
- Explains "why you" in the investor's terms
- Bullet points make it scannable
- Asks for opt-in before making the introduction
- Specific enough to be interesting, short enough to actually get read

---

### Template 3: LinkedIn Warm-Up Engagement Sequence (7-Day Plan)

Use this when you cannot get a direct or 2nd-degree intro and need to build familiarity before reaching out.

**Day 1 (Monday):**
- Follow the target investor on LinkedIn and Twitter/X
- Like their most recent post
- Read their last 10 posts to understand their interests and voice

**Day 2 (Tuesday):**
- Leave a thoughtful comment on their most recent LinkedIn post
- Comment must add value: share a data point, ask an insightful question, or offer a relevant perspective
- Example: If they post about AI regulation, comment with a specific child safety regulatory data point

**Day 3 (Wednesday):**
- Share one of their posts on your feed with your own commentary
- Tag them (but don't overdo it -- one tag is enough)
- Add genuine insight: "Interesting perspective from @[Investor]. This aligns with what we're seeing in the child safety compliance space, where 67+ new laws are creating..."

**Day 4 (Thursday):**
- Like and comment on another post
- Engage with other commenters on their posts (builds visibility without seeming desperate)

**Day 5 (Friday):**
- Publish your own post on a topic they care about (child safety, regtech, compliance trends)
- Don't mention them -- let your content speak for itself
- Use relevant hashtags they follow

**Day 6 (Saturday/Sunday):**
- Rest day -- don't engage (avoid seeming like you're stalking their profile)
- Prepare your connection request message

**Day 7 (Monday):**
- Send a personalized connection request:

> Hi [Investor Name], I've been following your insights on [specific topic from their posts] -- your take on [specific point] really resonated. I'm building in the child safety compliance space and would love to connect. -- [Your Name]

**After connection accepted (wait 24-48 hours):**

> Thanks for connecting, [Investor Name]. Your post about [specific topic] got me thinking about how it applies to the child safety compliance space. We're building Phosra to help platforms navigate the 67+ new child safety laws -- would love to share a 2-minute overview if you have bandwidth. No pitch deck, just a quick conversation about what we're seeing in the market.

---

### Template 4: Post-Conference/Event Follow-Up

Send within 24 hours of meeting. Reference something specific from your conversation.

**Subject:** Great meeting you at [Event Name] -- child safety compliance follow-up

> Hi [Investor Name],
>
> Really enjoyed our conversation at [Event Name] yesterday, especially your thoughts on [specific topic you discussed]. Your point about [specific insight] is something I've been thinking about a lot in the context of what we're building.
>
> As I mentioned, I'm raising a $950K pre-seed for Phosra. We're building compliance infrastructure for the 67+ child safety laws emerging worldwide -- a single API that handles age verification, parental consent, content restrictions, and audit reporting across all jurisdictions.
>
> I'd love to continue our conversation with a quick 20-minute call this week or next. I can share more about [specific aspect they showed interest in during your conversation].
>
> [If you took a photo together or exchanged something specific:] Attached is [the article/resource/slide] I mentioned.
>
> Looking forward to staying in touch,
> [Your Name]
>
> P.S. [Reference a personal detail: "Hope the rest of SXSW treated you well!" / "Let me know how that [personal thing they mentioned] goes!"]

**Why this works:**
- Specific references prove you actually talked (not a mass email)
- Connects back to what THEY said (ego-driven engagement)
- Light ask (20-minute call, not "invest in my company")
- Personal P.S. builds human connection
- Sent within 24 hours while memory is fresh

## 4. Prioritization Framework

### Scoring Model

Score each potential warm intro path on 5 dimensions. Total score determines priority tier.

| Dimension | Criteria | Points |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Connection Strength** | 1st degree (direct relationship) | **5** |
| | 2nd degree, strong mutual (close contact vouches) | **4** |
| | 2nd degree, weak mutual (acquaintance vouches) | **2** |
| | 3rd degree or event-based | **1** |
| **Thesis Alignment** | Perfect: Fund explicitly invests in child safety, compliance, regtech, trust & safety | **5** |
| | Good: Fund invests in adjacent areas (edtech, govtech, cybersecurity, privacy, SaaS infra) | **3** |
| | Adjacent: Generalist fund but partner has shown interest in safety/regulation | **1** |
| **Fund Deployment Signals** | New fund / actively deploying (announced new fund, recent investments, public statements about deal flow) | **3** |
| | Active but no strong signal (makes investments regularly, no pause/slowdown signals) | **2** |
| | Unknown or slow (no recent deals, possible fund recycling) | **0** |
| **Check Size Fit** | Sweet spot: $25K-$300K range (matches $950K pre-seed with room for multiple investors) | **2** |
| | Outside sweet spot (too small <$10K or too large >$500K typical check) | **0** |
| **COPPA/Child Safety Interest** | Public stance: Has written, tweeted, spoken, or lobbied on child safety / COPPA / KOSA | **3** |
| | Portfolio signal: Has invested in adjacent companies (age verification, content moderation, parental controls) | **2** |
| | No signal | **0** |

### Tier Classification

| Tier | Score | Action | Expected Volume |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** | 15-18 pts | Pursue immediately. Activate best available intro path. Personalize every touchpoint. | Top 15-20 targets |
| **Tier 2** | 10-14 pts | High priority. Activate intro paths within 1 week. Moderate personalization. | 30-40 targets |
| **Tier 3** | 5-9 pts | Medium priority. Queue for content-based warm-up or batch outreach. | 40-50 targets |
| **Below Tier 3** | <5 pts | Deprioritize. Only pursue if a high-quality intro path opens unexpectedly. | Archive for later |

### Scoring Example

**Example: Investor at a regtech-focused fund, 2nd degree through a strong mutual:**

| Dimension | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Connection Strength | 2nd degree, strong mutual | 4 |
| Thesis Alignment | Perfect (regtech fund) | 5 |
| Fund Signals | New fund, actively deploying | 3 |
| Check Size Fit | $50-150K typical check | 2 |
| COPPA Interest | Partner tweeted about KOSA | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | | **17 -- Tier 1** |

### Tiebreaker Criteria (within same tier)

When two targets have the same score:
1. **Intro path readiness:** Prefer paths you can activate today over those requiring setup
2. **Speed to close:** Prefer investors known for quick decisions (angels, solo GPs) over slow committee-based funds
3. **Strategic value beyond capital:** Prefer investors who bring customers, domain expertise, or follow-on introductions
4. **Signal value:** Prefer well-known names that make the cap table attractive to later investors

## 6. LinkedIn Optimization Checklist

Your LinkedIn profile is your landing page for investors. Every investor will look at your profile before taking a meeting.

### Profile Updates

- [ ] **Headline:** Update to signal fundraising founder status
  - Format: `Founder & CEO at Phosra | Building Child Safety Compliance Infrastructure | 3x Founder (3 exits) | Ex-Mastercard`
  - Do NOT put "Raising $950K" in headline -- too direct

- [ ] **About/Summary section:** Rewrite to tell your founder story
  - Paragraph 1: What Phosra does and why it matters (child safety compliance crisis)
  - Paragraph 2: Your background and why you're the right person (3 exits, Mastercard)
  - Paragraph 3: What you're looking for (always-on: "building a team of investors and advisors who care about child safety")
  - Include: phosra.com link, relevant keywords (COPPA, child safety, compliance, regtech)

- [ ] **Featured section:** Pin 3-4 items
  - Phosra website or investor one-pager
  - A thought leadership post about child safety legislation
  - Press coverage or speaking engagement (if available)
  - A post about your prior exits or Mastercard experience

- [ ] **Experience section:**

  - Never pitch in the connection request itself

- [ ] **Accept all inbound requests** from VCs, angels, founders, and industry contacts (grow your 1st-degree network)

## Appendix C: Outreach Do's and Don'ts

### Do's

- **Do** personalize every outreach. Reference something specific about the investor or fund.
- **Do** make it easy for connectors. Provide the forwardable blurb so they can copy-paste.
- **Do** follow up. Most intros happen after the 2nd or 3rd touchpoint, not the first.
- **Do** offer value before asking. Share an insight, data point, or introduction before requesting one.
- **Do** respect the double-opt-in. Never ask a connector to share your info without the investor's consent.
- **Do** track everything. If it's not in the spreadsheet, it didn't happen.
- **Do** move fast. Pre-seed rounds close quickly; a 48-hour response delay can cost you a meeting.
- **Do** send thank-you notes to connectors regardless of outcome.

### Don'ts

- **Don't** cold-email investors when a warm path exists (even a weak warm path beats a cold email).
- **Don't** mass-blast the same generic message to all connectors.
- **Don't** pitch in a LinkedIn connection request. Connect first, then message.
- **Don't** ask for an intro from someone you haven't spoken to in years without re-establishing the relationship first.
- **Don't** name-drop without permission. Don't say "Investor X told me to reach out" unless they actually did.
- **Don't** burn bridges with connectors by being pushy or not following up professionally.
- **Don't** over-rely on one path type. Diversify across the taxonomy.
- **Don't** forget to close the loop. Let connectors know the outcome of every intro they made.
