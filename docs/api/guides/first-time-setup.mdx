# First-Time Setup

This guide covers integrating Phosra into your application from scratch, including account creation, API key management, and your first enforcement run.

## 1. Create Your Account

Register via the API or sign up at [phosra.com/signup](https://www.phosra.com/signup):

```bash
curl -X POST https://phosra-api.fly.dev/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "developer@yourapp.com",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "name": "Your Name"
  }'
```

## 2. Get an API Key

Navigate to the [Developer Portal](https://www.phosra.com/dashboard/developers/keys) and generate an API key. Use `phosra_test_sk_*` keys during development and `phosra_live_sk_*` keys in production.

```bash
export PHOSRA_API_KEY="phosra_test_sk_your_key_here"
```

## 3. Use Quick Setup for Onboarding

The fastest path for your end users. When a parent signs up and adds their first child in your app, call the quick setup endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://phosra-api.fly.dev/api/v1/setup/quick \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSRA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "child_name": "Emma",
    "birth_date": "2016-03-15",
    "strictness": "recommended"
  }'
```

This returns a family, child, active policy with 45 rules, and a summary of key settings. Store the `family.id` and `child.id` in your database for subsequent calls.

## 4. Connect Platforms

For each platform the family uses, create a compliance link:

```bash
curl -X POST https://phosra-api.fly.dev/api/v1/compliance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSRA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "family_id": "FAMILY_UUID",
    "platform_id": "nextdns",
    "credentials": "nextdns-api-key"
  }'
```

List available platforms with `GET /platforms` to see what integrations are supported.

## 5. Register Webhooks

Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications when enforcement completes, policies change, or new activity is reported:

```bash
curl -X POST https://phosra-api.fly.dev/api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSRA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "family_id": "FAMILY_UUID",
    "url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/phosra",
    "events": ["enforcement.completed", "policy.updated"]
  }'
```

## 6. Trigger Enforcement

Push the policy to all connected platforms:

```bash
curl -X POST https://phosra-api.fly.dev/api/v1/children/CHILD_UUID/enforce \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSRA_API_KEY"
```

Your webhook endpoint will receive a notification when enforcement completes.
