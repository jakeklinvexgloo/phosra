# Welcome to Phosra

Phosra is a universal child safety policy layer. Define age-appropriate rules once, then push them to every platform your child uses — from Netflix to NextDNS to Apple Screen Time.

## What You Can Do

## Quick Example

Set up a child with age-appropriate protections in a single API call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://phosra-api.fly.dev/api/v1/setup/quick \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "child_name": "Emma",
    "birth_date": "2016-03-15",
    "strictness": "recommended"
  }'
```

This creates a family, adds the child, computes their age bracket, and generates all 45 rule categories with age-appropriate defaults.
