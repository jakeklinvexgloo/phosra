# Enforcement

**Enforcement** is the process of pushing a child's active policy rules to connected platforms. When you trigger enforcement, Phosra creates an **enforcement job** that fans out to each connected platform, translating your universal rules into platform-specific configurations.

The enforcement flow:

1. **Trigger** -- Call `POST /children/{childID}/enforce` (optionally targeting specific platforms)
2. **Job created** -- Returns a `202 Accepted` with the job ID
3. **Fan-out** -- Phosra pushes rules to each connected platform in parallel
4. **Results** -- Each platform returns a result: `completed`, `partial`, or `failed`
5. **Job completes** -- Overall status reflects the aggregate result

Enforcement can be triggered manually, automatically (when a policy changes), or via webhook events. You can also enforce a single compliance link with `POST /compliance/{linkID}/enforce`.

Per-platform results include counts of `rules_applied`, `rules_skipped` (not supported by the platform), and `rules_failed`, plus an optional `error_message` for debugging.
