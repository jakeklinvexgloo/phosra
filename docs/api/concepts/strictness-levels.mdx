# Strictness Levels

When generating rules (via quick setup or `generate-from-age`), you can specify a **strictness** preset that shifts all rule defaults tighter or looser relative to the age-group baseline.

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `strict` | Tighter limits across the board. Less screen time, more restrictive content ratings, stronger web filters, social features disabled. Best for families who want maximum protection. |
| `recommended` | Balanced defaults based on pediatric and child safety research. This is the default if no strictness is specified. |
| `relaxed` | Looser limits that give older children more autonomy. More screen time, broader content access, social features enabled with monitoring. Best for families who want a lighter touch. |

Strictness is applied at rule-generation time. After generation, you can customize any individual rule. Changing strictness later requires re-generating rules (which overwrites existing configurations for that policy).

## Example: Screen Time by Strictness (Age 10)

| Strictness | Daily Limit | Bedtime |
|------------|------------|---------|
| `strict` | 60 min | 8:00 PM |
| `recommended` | 120 min | 9:00 PM |
| `relaxed` | 180 min | 10:00 PM |
