# Policies & Rules

A **policy** is a named collection of rules assigned to a child. Policies have a status (`draft`, `active`, or `paused`) and a priority number for ordering when multiple policies exist.

A **rule** belongs to a policy and controls one of 45 **rule categories** -- from content ratings and screen time limits to privacy settings and algorithmic safety controls. Each rule has:

- **category** -- Which of the 45 categories it controls (e.g., `time_daily_limit`, `content_rating`)
- **enabled** -- Whether this rule is active
- **config** -- Category-specific configuration JSON (e.g., `{"minutes": 90}` for screen time)

You can create rules manually or use `generate-from-age` to auto-populate all 45 categories with age-appropriate defaults. The 45 categories span content, time, purchase, social, web, privacy, monitoring, algorithmic safety, notifications, advertising, compliance, and legislation-driven controls.

Only **active** policies are enforced. You can have multiple policies per child (e.g., "School Day" and "Weekend") and switch between them using activate/pause.
