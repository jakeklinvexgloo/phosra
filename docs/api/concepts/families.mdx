# Families

A **family** is the top-level organizational unit in Phosra. Every child, policy, platform connection, and webhook belongs to a family.

Families can have multiple adult members, each with a role: **owner** (full control, including billing), **parent** (can manage children and policies), or **guardian** (read access plus limited management). A family must have at least one owner.

When you create a family, you are automatically added as the owner. You can then invite other adults and add children. Children do not have user accounts -- they are represented as child profiles within the family.
