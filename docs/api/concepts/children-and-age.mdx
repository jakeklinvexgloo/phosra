# Children & Age Groups

A **child** is a profile within a family, defined by their name and birth date. Phosra uses the birth date to compute the child's current age and map them to an **age group**, which determines the default rule configurations.

Age groups are:

| Group | Ages | Screen Time Default | Content Rating |
|-------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Toddler | 0-2 | 30 min/day | TV-Y only |
| Preschool | 3-5 | 60 min/day | TV-Y, G |
| Elementary | 6-9 | 90 min/day | TV-Y7, PG, E |
| Tween | 10-12 | 120 min/day | TV-PG, PG-13, E10+ |
| Teen | 13-15 | 150 min/day | TV-14, PG-13, T |
| Older Teen | 16-17 | 180 min/day | TV-14, R (with parent), T |

When a child's age group changes (e.g., they turn 13), you can regenerate their policy rules to match the new bracket using `POST /policies/{policyID}/generate-from-age`.
