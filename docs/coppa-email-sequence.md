## Email 1: "The Wake-Up Call"

**Send Date:** Monday, February 24, 2026 (57 days before deadline)
**Send Time:** 9:00 AM ET

**Subject Line:** COPPA 2.0 hasn't passed. The $53K-per-violation rule has.

**Preview Text:** The FTC's amended COPPA Rule takes full effect April 22. Most teams are preparing for the wrong thing.

---

You have probably seen the headlines: "COPPA 2.0 stalls in Congress." You may have moved it to the back of your compliance queue. That would be a mistake.

Here is what is actually happening:

**COPPA 2.0** (S.836) is a bill. It has not been signed into law. That part of the headlines is accurate.

**The FTC's amended COPPA Rule** is a different matter entirely. The Federal Trade Commission finalized sweeping updates to the existing COPPA Rule in 2024 — expanding its scope, tightening its requirements, and increasing its penalties. These amendments carry the full force of federal law.

**The full compliance deadline is April 22, 2026. That is 57 days from today.**

The amended rule introduces six new requirements that most organizations have not addressed:

1. Separate verifiable parental consent for third-party data sharing
2. Written data retention and deletion policies
3. Enhanced direct notice to parents before data collection
4. Formal third-party oversight obligations
5. Expanded definition of personal information (including biometric and health data)
6. New acceptable consent mechanisms

The penalty structure has also been updated: **$53,088 per violation, per child, per instance.**

This is not theoretical. The FTC has publicly stated that COPPA enforcement is a top priority for 2026. They have the budget, the staffing, and the precedent — Epic Games ($520M), YouTube ($170M), TikTok ($5.7M) — to back it up.

The distinction between the bill and the rule is not a technicality. It is the difference between "we have time" and "we have 57 days."

We wrote a detailed breakdown of exactly what the amended rule requires, who it applies to, and what the enforcement timeline looks like.

## Email 2: "The Checklist"

**Send Date:** Tuesday, March 3, 2026 (50 days before deadline)
**Send Time:** 9:00 AM ET

**Subject Line:** 6 things your platform needs before April 22

**Preview Text:** The FTC's amended COPPA Rule has 6 new requirements. Here is exactly what each one means for your team.

---

Last week, we broke down why the FTC's amended COPPA Rule — not the COPPA 2.0 bill — is the compliance event that matters right now. The full compliance deadline is April 22, 2026.

Today, we are making it concrete. Here are the six new requirements and what each one demands from your organization.

### 1. Separate Verifiable Parental Consent for Third-Party Sharing

The old rule required parental consent for data collection. The amended rule goes further: if you share a child's personal information with any third party, you now need **separate, specific consent** for that sharing — distinct from the general collection consent.

**What to do:** Audit every third-party integration that receives child data. Implement a consent flow that explicitly names each third party and the data being shared. Document the consent separately from your general VPC records.

### 2. Written Data Retention and Deletion Policy

You must now maintain a **written policy** specifying how long you retain children's personal information, why you retain it, and when and how you delete it. This policy must be available to parents upon request.

**What to do:** Draft a retention policy with specific timeframes for each data category. Implement automated deletion workflows that enforce those timeframes. Ensure parent-facing documentation reflects the policy.

### 3. Enhanced Direct Notice to Parents

The amended rule requires more detailed **direct notice** to parents before collecting data from their children. The notice must clearly describe: what data you collect, how you use it, who you share it with, and how parents can exercise their rights.

**What to do:** Rewrite your parental notice templates. Include granular descriptions of data types (the rule now covers biometric, health, and device-level data). Test that notices are delivered and acknowledged before any collection begins.

### 4. Third-Party Oversight Obligations

If you share children's data with third parties, you are now responsible for ensuring those third parties **maintain adequate protections**. You must take "reasonable steps" to monitor their data practices and ensure compliance.

**What to do:** Establish vendor review processes for every third party that handles child data. Include contractual requirements for COPPA compliance. Schedule periodic audits or attestation reviews.

### 5. Expanded Definition of Personal Information

The amended rule broadens what counts as "personal information" to include **biometric identifiers, health information, and persistent identifiers** used for behavioral advertising. If you collect any of these from children, COPPA now applies.

**What to do:** Re-catalog every data point you collect from users under 13. Flag any biometric data (voice prints, face geometry), health data, or device identifiers used for ad targeting. Apply COPPA protections to all of them.

### 6. New Consent Mechanisms

The rule introduces additional accepted methods for verifiable parental consent, including **knowledge-based authentication and facial recognition matching**. It also tightens requirements on existing methods.

**What to do:** Review your current consent mechanism. Evaluate whether adding new methods improves your coverage and reduces friction. Ensure whatever method you use meets the amended rule's verification standard.

We built a compliance readiness checklist that maps each of these requirements to specific implementation steps, with estimated timelines and technical guidance.

## Email 3: "The Risk"

**Send Date:** Tuesday, March 17, 2026 (36 days before deadline)
**Send Time:** 9:00 AM ET

**Subject Line:** $530 million in exposure — and the FTC is watching

**Preview Text:** The per-violation math on COPPA is staggering. Here is what non-compliance actually costs.

---

In December 2022, Epic Games agreed to pay **$520 million** to settle FTC charges that it violated COPPA and used dark patterns to charge players. It was the largest FTC enforcement action in the agency's history involving children's privacy.

It was not the first. YouTube paid **$170 million**. TikTok paid **$5.7 million** (and then agreed to an additional $368 million settlement with European regulators). The pattern is consistent and accelerating.

Now consider the math under the FTC's amended COPPA Rule, which takes full effect **April 22, 2026**:

**$53,088** — the penalty per violation, per child, per instance.

If your platform has 10,000 children and you commit a single category of violation (say, collecting data without proper parental consent), the exposure calculation is straightforward:

> 10,000 children x $53,088 = **$530,880,000**

That is over half a billion dollars for a single violation category. If you are also sharing data with third parties without separate consent, or lacking a written retention policy, each additional violation category multiplies the exposure.

### This is not hypothetical

The FTC has publicly stated that COPPA enforcement is a **top priority for 2026**. They have:

- Increased the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection's staffing
- Published updated compliance guidance specifically referencing the amended rule's April 2026 deadline
- Signaled that they will pursue **both large platforms and mid-market operators** who fail to comply

### The enforcement precedent is set

| Company | Year | Settlement | Violation |
|---------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Epic Games | 2022 | $520M | COPPA violations + dark patterns |
| YouTube (Google) | 2019 | $170M | Collecting children's data without consent |
| TikTok | 2019 | $5.7M | Collecting data from children under 13 |
| Fortnite (Epic) | 2022 | $245M | Dark patterns targeting children |

These cases were brought under the **old** COPPA Rule. The amended rule is broader in scope, stricter in requirements, and higher in penalties.

### What this means for your team

If you operate a platform, app, or service that is directed at children — or that you have actual knowledge is used by children under 13 — the amended COPPA Rule applies to you. The compliance deadline is 36 days away.

The cost of compliance is measured in engineering hours. The cost of non-compliance is measured in nine figures.

## Email 4: "The Solution"

**Send Date:** Tuesday, March 31, 2026 (22 days before deadline)
**Send Time:** 9:00 AM ET

**Subject Line:** One API to handle every COPPA requirement

**Preview Text:** Each FTC requirement maps to a Phosra enforcement rule. Here is exactly how it works.

---

You know the deadline: **April 22, 2026**. You know the six new requirements. You know the penalties.

The question now is implementation. And the honest answer is that building COPPA compliance infrastructure from scratch — across every platform your organization touches — takes months, not weeks.

That is why we built Phosra.

Phosra is the infrastructure layer for child safety compliance. One API integration to handle age verification, parental consent, content restrictions, and audit reporting across every platform that adopts the standard. Every requirement in the FTC's amended COPPA Rule maps directly to a Phosra enforcement rule.

Here is how:

### Requirement 1: Separate VPC for Third-Party Sharing
**Phosra rule:** `parental_consent_gate` + `privacy_data_sharing`

Phosra's consent gate enforces granular, per-purpose parental consent. When a child's data would be shared with a third party, Phosra triggers a separate consent flow — distinct from your general collection consent — and logs the parent's response with a timestamped, auditable record.

### Requirement 2: Written Data Retention Policy
**Phosra rule:** `data_deletion_request` + `compliance_attestation`

Define your retention windows in the Phosra dashboard. Phosra automatically enforces deletion schedules across every connected platform and generates the written policy documentation the FTC requires — including parent-facing disclosures.

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Direct Notice
**Phosra rule:** `parental_consent_gate`

Phosra's consent flow includes configurable direct notice templates that satisfy the amended rule's enhanced disclosure requirements. Notices are delivered, tracked, and archived before any data collection begins.

### Requirement 4: Third-Party Oversight
**Phosra rule:** `privacy_data_sharing` + `compliance_attestation`

Phosra monitors every third-party data transfer in real time. If a connected platform or integration falls out of compliance, Phosra blocks the data flow automatically and flags it in your audit log.

### Requirement 5: Expanded Personal Information Definition
**Phosra rule:** `commercial_data_ban` + `targeted_ad_block`

Phosra's enforcement engine recognizes the amended rule's expanded definition of personal information — including biometric identifiers, health data, and persistent device identifiers. The `commercial_data_ban` rule prevents any commercial use of this data, and `targeted_ad_block` disables behavioral advertising across all connected platforms.

### Requirement 6: New Consent Mechanisms
**Phosra rule:** `parental_consent_gate`

Phosra supports multiple verifiable parental consent methods out of the box, including the new mechanisms approved under the amended rule. You configure which methods to offer; Phosra handles the verification, logging, and compliance documentation.

### What the integration looks like

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phosra.com/v1/enforcement \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_..." \
  -d '{
    "child_id": "ch_emma_01",
    "law": "FTC_COPPA",
    "rules": [
      "parental_consent_gate",
      "targeted_ad_block",
      "commercial_data_ban",
      "data_deletion_request",
      "privacy_data_sharing",
      "compliance_attestation"
    ]
  }'
```

One call. Six requirements. Enforced across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Roblox, and every other connected platform.

You do not need to build a COPPA compliance engine. You need to integrate with one.

## Email 5: "The Final Call"

**Send Date:** Tuesday, April 14, 2026 (8 days before deadline)
**Send Time:** 8:00 AM ET

**Subject Line:** 8 days.

**Preview Text:** The FTC's amended COPPA Rule takes full effect April 22. Here is what you can still do.

---

The FTC's amended COPPA Rule takes full effect on **April 22, 2026**.

That is 8 days from today.

If your organization collects data from children under 13 — or operates a platform that children under 13 use — and you have not implemented the six new requirements of the amended rule, you are exposed to **$53,088 in penalties per violation, per child, per instance.**

The FTC has stated that COPPA enforcement is their top priority this year. The precedent is set: Epic Games paid $520 million. YouTube paid $170 million. The amended rule is stricter than the one those companies violated.

### Here is what you can do in 8 days

We built Phosra for exactly this scenario. One API integration. Full COPPA compliance. Enforced across every platform your organization touches.

**What Phosra covers:**
- Verifiable parental consent with separate flows for third-party sharing
- Automated data retention enforcement and deletion schedules
- Enhanced direct notice delivery and tracking
- Real-time third-party data sharing oversight
- Expanded personal information protections (biometric, health, device IDs)
- Full audit trail for FTC compliance documentation

**How long it takes:** Organizations integrate Phosra's COPPA enforcement in under an hour. The API is live. The documentation is ready. The enforcement rules are pre-configured for the amended COPPA Rule.

This is not a sales pitch. This is arithmetic. The cost of integration is trivial. The cost of non-compliance is not.
