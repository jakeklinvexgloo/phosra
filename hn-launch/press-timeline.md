## 2. Narrative Arc

The 13 releases are sequenced to tell a single coherent story across four acts, each building credibility and urgency for the next.

### Act 1 -- Pre-Raise: Open-Source Credibility (Phase 1, Feb 21 - Mar 7)

**Releases:** PR-01, PR-02, PR-03

The fundraise opens with three product launches in rapid succession: the open-source PCSS spec, the interactive compliance checker, and the public law registry API. These are not fundraise announcements -- they are technical artifacts that establish Phosra as an infrastructure company, not a pitch deck. The audience is developers and technical journalists. The tone is "here is something useful you can use right now, for free, no auth required." This sequence earns the right to fundraise by demonstrating that the product exists and the data is real.

The HN launch (PR-02) is the centerpiece of this phase. If it lands well, it generates organic developer attention that validates the spec's technical substance. The first comment, objection playbook, and checklist are already prepared in the hn-launch/ directory.

### Act 2 -- Thought Leadership: Become the Reference (Phase 2, Mar 8 - Mar 28)

**Releases:** PR-04, PR-05, PR-06, PR-07, PR-08

Phase 2 shifts from "we built something" to "we understand this space better than anyone." The compliance landscape report (PR-04) is designed to become the citable resource that journalists and analysts reference whenever they write about child safety regulation. The COPPA compliance guide (PR-05) targets the engineers who will actually implement compliance before April 22. The founder essay (PR-06) adds the personal narrative that investors need to believe in the team, not just the product.

The GitHub traction update (PR-07) proves the spec has developer adoption beyond Phosra's own use. The FTC public comment (PR-08) is the credibility crescendo -- it positions Phosra as a legitimate regulatory voice, not just a startup with opinions. These five releases collectively build the authority that makes the Active Fundraise phase credible.

### Act 3 -- Regulatory Urgency: The COPPA Forcing Function (Phase 3, Mar 29 - Apr 25)

**Releases:** PR-09, PR-10, PR-11

Phase 3 leverages the approaching April 22 COPPA deadline as a forcing function for both platform customers and investors. The op-ed (PR-09) is the highest-reach play of the entire campaign -- a major-outlet placement arguing that most platforms are not ready. The first pilot LOI (PR-10) converts the narrative from infrastructure thesis to customer traction. The COPPA deadline day analysis (PR-11) positions Phosra as the authoritative data source in real time.

For investors, the story in this phase is: the deadline is real, platforms are scrambling, and Phosra already has the infrastructure they need. The pilot LOI is the single most important proof point for converting investor meetings into term sheet conversations.

### Act 4 -- Close: Proof and Momentum (Phase 4, Apr 26 - May 31)

**Releases:** PR-12, PR-13

The final phase delivers proof of value (the pilot case study) and closes the loop (the raise announcement). The case study (PR-12) gives every remaining angel investor a concrete answer to "does this actually work?" The raise announcement (PR-13) generates inbound for the seed round by signaling that the pre-seed thesis was validated: regulatory urgency drove adoption, and adoption drove fundraise success.

The raise announcement deliberately comes last -- after the product, the data, the thought leadership, the regulatory engagement, the pilot, and the case study have all been published. By the time the money headline drops, the company's credibility has been built across 12 prior releases. The announcement is a capstone, not a starting gun.
