This isn't imaginary—research in psychology and neuroscience shows several reasons why self-harm (like cutting) can create a short-term sense of feeling 'better': Distraction and shift in focus. Intense emotional pain can feel unbearable. Physical pain demands immediate attention from the brain and temporarily pulls focus away from emotional turmoil. Pain offset relief. The strongest relief often comes not from the pain itself, but from when the pain stops. The brain experiences this sudden drop in physical pain as very rewarding. Biological/chemical response. Injury triggers the body's natural pain-management system, including the release of beta-endorphins. Sense of control. When everything feels chaotic inside, the act can feel like something the person chooses and controls.
