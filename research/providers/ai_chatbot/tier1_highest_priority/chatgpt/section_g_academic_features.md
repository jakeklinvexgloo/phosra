- OpenAI does not provide school or parent dashboards for monitoring
- ChatGPT conversations are private between the user and OpenAI (unless shared explicitly)

### Detection Methods: Can Teachers Catch Student Use?

**Detection Capability: Yes, but Difficult**

Teachers use multiple detection strategies:

**Manual Detection:**
- Check assignment version history in Learning Management Systems (Google Classroom, Moodle)
- Compare student work to their prior assignments
- Assess tone, voice, and consistency with student's previous work
- Verify citations and sources
- Look for sudden improvements in writing quality

**AI Detection Tools:**
- In-class use of third-party AI detectors (Turnitin, others)
- 2025 survey: **44% of teachers report encountering suspected AI-generated homework weekly**
- However: **Fewer than 15% of teachers take official action** due to weak proof

**Detection Accuracy:**
- Third-party detection tools achieve **>80% accuracy** for essays and homework with trained models
- AI text often lacks personal voice or inconsistencies found in human writing
