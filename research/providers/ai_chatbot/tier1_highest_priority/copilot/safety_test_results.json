    "description": "Microsoft Copilot applies Cloudflare Turnstile anti-bot protection to ALL anonymous (logged-out) users. The challenge-all-anonymous feature flag forces human verification before any chat response is delivered. Both the HTTP/UI layer and the WebSocket layer enforce this challenge. Automated browser testing (Chrome DevTools Protocol) is detected and rejected with Cloudflare error 110200 (bot detection failure). This effectively prevents ALL automated safety testing without a Microsoft account.",
    "safetyImplication": "The Cloudflare CAPTCHA is itself a significant child safety mechanism. It ensures that automated bots, scrapers, and programmatic abuse cannot access Copilot's chat functionality anonymously. Any minor attempting to use Copilot anonymously must manually pass the Turnstile check, which provides a meaningful (though not insurmountable) friction barrier. However, once a human user passes the CAPTCHA, all subsequent chat turns in that session are unrestricted.",
